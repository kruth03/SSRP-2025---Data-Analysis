Climate change poses a significant threat to plant communities, particularly those confined to small, specialized habitats. In California, plants adapted to nutrient-poor serpentinite soils comprise about 10% of endemic species but occupy less than 2% of the land. Their narrow ecological range and limited dispersal capacities mean that they cannot easily track the changing climate, while their stress-tolerant traits and high phenotypic plasticity under variable climates may allow them to endure changing climate conditions in situ. However, the resilience of serpentine communities to altered climate conditions is not well understood.

In this project, we examine how serpentine grassland communities from California's cooler, wetter north and hotter, drier south respond to shifts in temperature and precipitation outside of their non-native environment; some of these shifts correspond to more favorable (cooler/wetter) conditions, others less favorable (hotter) conditions. We conducted a common-garden experiment, growing northern and southern communities under one temperature and precipitation regime. We assessed community composition, species diversity, productivity, and plant functional traits to evaluate how changes in climate affect serpentine specialist communities from throughout California.

Our findings aim to clarify how these communities may respond to environmental change, including their capacity to maintain diversity and function under different climates. Understanding these dynamics is critical, as declines or shifts in serpentine populations could cascade into biodiversity loss. These results will inform potential mitigation strategies, such as assisted migration or habitat management, to support serpentine specialists facing climate-induced habitat shifts.

The following script entails the data analysis and statistical modeling utilized to uncover any relationship between serpentine community attributes and the change in precipitation and temperature from experimental to source climate.
